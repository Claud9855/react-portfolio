            <p>
                I am a self-taught programmer with some college education in computer science and a certificate
                for full-stack engineering from the university of connecticut. I have a background working mostly
                with java building gui applications and server-side programming with HTML, css, and Javascript. 
                I have expriences working with different types of programming technologies ranging from the front-end
                and back-end. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I still consider myself as a amuter programmer still having a long way to go, but I hope I can still
                be in service to make your ideas a reality.
            </p>
